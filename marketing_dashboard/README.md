# Data Sources

The dashboard utilizes two primary data sources:

1. Campaign Performance Data: Contains basic campaign metrics including spend, impressions, clicks, conversions, and revenue.
2. Expanded Marketing Data: Contains detailed metrics for different marketing channels:
   - Ad platform metrics (spend, clicks, impressions, CTR, conversion rate)
   - Social media metrics (engagements, reach, CTR)
   - Email marketing metrics (recipients, opens, clicks, bounce rate, unsubscribe rate)

# Key Metrics

## Campaign Performance Metrics
- CTR (Click-Through Rate): Percentage of impressions that resulted in clicks
- CPC (Cost Per Click): Average cost for each click
- CPA (Cost Per Acquisition): Average cost for each conversion
- ROAS (Return On Ad Spend): Revenue generated per dollar spent
- Budget Utilization: Percentage of allocated budget that was spent

## Cross-Channel Metrics
- Ad-to-Social Ratio: Ratio of ad clicks to social engagements
- Email-to-Ad Ratio: Ratio of email clicks to ad clicks
- Campaign Effectiveness Score: Composite score based on ad CTR, social CTR, and email click rate

# Data Processing

The data processing script (`data_cleaning.py`) performs the following operations:

1. Data Loading: Loads raw data from CSV files
2. Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, converts date formats, and ensures data consistency
3. Metric Calculation: Calculates derived metrics and KPIs
4. Data Analysis: Performs basic analysis on the cleaned data
5. Data Export: Saves processed data for visualization

# Data Integration

The data integration script (`data_integration.py`) combines processed campaign performance data with expanded marketing data to create a unified dataset for comprehensive analysis.

# Predictive Analytics

The predictive analytics script (`predictive_analytics.py`) uses machine learning to forecast future campaign performance and identify factors that influence marketing success.

# Automated Reporting

The automated reporting script (`automated_reporting.py`) generates regular performance reports, including summary statistics and visualizations, compiled into a PDF format.

# Dashboard Queries

The SQL queries (`dashboard_queries.sql`) provide the foundation for dashboard visualizations, including:

1. Overall campaign performance analysis
2. Channel performance comparison
3. Time-based performance trends
4. Campaign efficiency analysis
5. Ad platform performance comparison
6. Social platform engagement analysis
7. Email campaign performance analysis
8. Cross-channel performance analysis
9. Campaign effectiveness ranking

# Visualization

The Tableau workbook (`marketing_dashboard.twb`) contains visualizations for:

1. Executive Summary: High-level overview of marketing performance
2. Campaign Performance: Detailed analysis of individual campaigns
3. Channel Analysis: Performance comparison across different channels
4. Time Trends: Performance metrics over time
5. Cross-Channel Insights: Analysis of how channels interact and influence each other
6. Budget Analysis: Analysis of budget allocation and utilization
